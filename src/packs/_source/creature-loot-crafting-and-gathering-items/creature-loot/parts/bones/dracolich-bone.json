When drunk, the user is instantly killed and their soul is destroyed, unless it has been removed via a specially prepared Imprisonment spell with a Phylactery as the material component. If it has, roll 1d20. On a 20, the user is revived as a Lich. Their alignment becomes evil, if it wasn't already, and they may become an NPC under the DM's control.</p></section>",
