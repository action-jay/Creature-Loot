Any non-demon creature within 30 feet of the horn that hears the drone (including the user) must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. A creature that can't hear automatically succeeds on the save. The effect on the creature ends if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to splash it with holy water. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, it is immune to the drone for the next 24 hours.</p></section>",
