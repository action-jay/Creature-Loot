Can be carefully crafted (alchemist's supplies) in one of the following potions: Potion of Necrotic Resistance, Potion of Poison Resistance, Potion of Psychic Resistance, Potion of Magic Resistance, Potion of Evasion (for 1 hour, if subjected to a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage, take half damage on a failed save and no damage on a success), or Potion of Truesight (grants truesight out to 120 feet for 1 hour). When the Demilich reforms, all un-crafted teeth return to the Demilich. If the Phylactery is destroyed, these items crumble into useless dust.</p></section>",
